# 4D-Pop-Resources-Buddy
From 4D Pop Image Buddy, extended to resources, with search improvement

**** "4DPop Resources Buddy.4dbase" ****
VERSION 1.1.00, on 17th January 2020
Rewriting of this amazing good component : "4DPop Image Buddy.4dbase".

The goal was to
- have a global searchbox, displaying all folders containing files with the pattern in the file's name.
- extends to "Resources" rather than "Images", like done with 4D Resources tool.
- correct the modification done in FOLDER LIST and DOCUMENT LIST (folders and files no more sorted).

DONE
• Display bug for the picts in the listbox. Corrected just adding horizontal and vertical grid !
• Splitters remplaced with real 4D splitters.
• Layout revisited like 4D tool, with a preview added.
• Menus on right click all revisited, adding more "copy" than just the content : absolute path, relative path, relative path with "/", and file name.
• Add a global searchbox : really powerfull !!!
• Works for all kinds of files in the resource folder, not only images.
• Add this version text
